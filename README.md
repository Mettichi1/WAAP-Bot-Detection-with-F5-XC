# 🔒 F5 Distributed Cloud (XC) Labs – WAAP, Rate Limiting & Bot Defense  
This repository covers hands-on experience with F5 XC security labs:
   🔹 Web App & Api Protection (WAAP) Security: Deployed OWASP Juice Shop, configured WAAP policies, and tested API protection. 
   🔹 Bot Defense: Implemented signature-based bot detection, protected endpoints, and validated mitigation.


## **1️⃣ Introduction**  
As part of my hands-on journey with **F5 Distributed Cloud (XC)**, I explored advanced security features through two in-depth labs focused on:  

✅ **Web Application & API Protection (WAAP)**  
✅ **Rate Limiting & Service Policies**  
✅ **Bot Defense & Automated Threat Mitigation**  

These labs provided practical insights into securing web applications, fine-tuning WAAP policies, detecting malicious users, protecting APIs, mitigating bot-driven threats, and enforcing service policies with rate limiting.
